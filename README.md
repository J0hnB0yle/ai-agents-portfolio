# AI Agents Portfolio

A collection of specialized AI agents built to demonstrate practical applications of large language models for business process optimization. Each agent serves a specific business function and leverages Claude API for advanced natural language understanding and generation.

## Overview

This portfolio showcases my expertise in:
- Building practical AI applications for business use cases
- Leveraging large language models (specifically Claude) for task automation
- Developing both command-line and web-based interfaces for AI tools
- Implementing proper software architecture and best practices
